Project:
    - Added stub files mainly because:
        - I prefer static typing.
        - Often, type hints in cogs extended 120 columns, now we have type hints still, and shorter cogs.
        - Visual purposes, similar to conventional python type hinting has no effect on the client.
    - Type hints are only used in non-stub files to declare discord.py implicit conversions.
    - All files have had non-stub type hints removed (minus conversions)

template_objects:
    - Redesigned color list to ONLY append discord.Color or discord.Colour values.

sovereign:
    - New extension for me only.

client:
    - Removed 'close()' overwrite. Absolutely useless.
    - Added client.send() to omit calls to the template objects
